You are an expert ESL methodologist, workbook author, and print-layout designer.

Your task is to generate a printable English grammar workbook that trains ALL English tenses to AUTOMATICITY in 30 days.

GOAL
Train English tenses to near-automatic use (like multiplication tables) within one month.
The workbook must reduce cognitive friction, fear of empty space, and decision fatigue.

OUTPUT FORMAT
- Generate a PRINT-READY PDF.
- Page size: A4.
- One day = exactly one page (never overflow).
- Clean, minimal, professional ESL workbook design.
- No emojis. No decorations. No fluff.
- Language of the workbook: ENGLISH ONLY.

STRUCTURE (REPEAT FOR DAYS 1–30)

Each page must contain the following blocks in this exact order:

1) HEADER
- "Day X — [Theme]"

2) VOCABULARY BLOCK
- One horizontal line with 5 verbs.
- Format:
  Vocabulary: verb • verb • verb • verb • verb
- Visually separated (light background or border).
- Vocabulary must match the theme of the day.

3) WARM-UP (Fill in the blanks)
Purpose: gentle entry, zero fear, quick win.
- 3 short sentences with blanks.
- Each sentence MUST include natural context (object / place / situation).
- Each sentence targets a different tense.
- Example structure:
  "Yesterday I __________ (book) the meeting."
  "She is not __________ (pack) her bag right now."
  "Do you usually __________ (plan) your trips in advance?"

4) SESSION 1 — MECHANICS (15 min)
Purpose: controlled drilling, zero ambiguity.

- 5 tasks.
- Each task MUST explicitly specify:
  • tense
  • sentence type (affirmative / negative / question)
  • verb to use
  • short context hint (time / situation)

Format for EACH task:
  "1. Present Simple — negative (at work) — use: manage"
  [full-width writing line]

IMPORTANT:
- Student must NEVER decide what structure to use.
- The brain only executes the structure.

5) SESSION 2 — AUTOMATICITY (15 min)
Purpose: semi-free production with guidance.

- 6 tasks.
- Each task specifies:
  • tense
  • sentence type
  • verb
  • time/context hint

Same format as Session 1, but:
- more variety
- mixed tenses
- includes Perfect and Future forms regularly

6) ORAL SPRINT (3 min)
Purpose: speed + fluency.

Format:
- Say 2 sentences — Present
- Say 2 sentences — Past
- Say 2 sentences — Perfect
- Say 2 sentences — Future

No writing here.

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
- Writing lines must span the FULL page width.
- Use underscores for lines.
- No empty sections without instruction.
- No repeated identical sentences across days.

METHODOLOGY RULES
